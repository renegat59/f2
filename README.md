# What is F2
F2 is a simple blogging platform written in PHP. It's being created, because of need of super lightweight platform for having my own blog.
The idea behind F2 is to create somethign very light, fast and easily hackable.

# What F2 is not:
F2 is not a Wordpress or any other popular blogging platform competitor. It is not:
1. Universal (Only PHP 7+)
2. Supporting many databases (only MySql in plans)
3. Supporting many languages
4. Supporting posts versioning (at least in the first roadmap)
5. For normal people, rather for IT passionates, who like writing things using Markdown
